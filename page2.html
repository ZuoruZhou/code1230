 <p>Figure – 2: the Growth of Childless Couple in Sydney from 2011 to 2016<br><br>

<p>The map shows the change of the family without child living area in NSW from 2011 to 2016, and where these families are concentrated. The colour scale from white to orange illustrate the population change of childless families. The height of ‘bars’ describes the percent growth of this kind of families, the greater proportion the higher the region is shown. <br><br>
 
 
 <p>The initial research was to analyze the different family composition in Sydney. In the given data set, G39 category shows the lone people and young couple would be willing to live in the city or other place close to public transport. However, the families with children would like to live in quiet region or rural suburb rather than city regions. Thus, the city actually can be considered as kind of lonely place for young people to work in concrete offices.  <br><br>
 
 
 
 
<p>As the figure 1 shown, the spaces close to city are gradually becoming populated. This might because majority of young couple does not have private transport tools which would conduct them live close to the public transport such as train line. On the other hand, the existing condition would affect this distribution. The conditions basically include wealth (usually the people living in city and north Sydney are wealthier than others), the family type and environmental condition.<br><br>


   
<p>Moreover, the distribution of the household and family composition have significant differences to others. The city and north Sydney area has more apartments and flats compared to other dwelling type. That because it needs to satisfy citizens’ need such as convenient transport net. The further west from city, the more houses with families with children start to appear in the map. This can prove that the property in the west region is cheaper than city and north Sydney area. <br><br> 
<p>The latte line perfectly divides North Sydney and other regions. In North Sydney, the dwellings basically are more than one storey which means the population there is wealthier than other area. In the CBD area, high rising apartments and flats are dominated which are expensive. This can mean that people living there is rich as well. For other regions, it can be considered as more standard and fit for a family living for years.  <br><br>

<p>In conclusion, the childless families can be considered as socio-economic factors. The latte line divides the differences between cultural values. For example, western areas would have greater rate of birth than eastern area. Thus, wealth is the most important factor influenced the childless family. Moreover, the distribution and concentration of childless family illustrates whether the cities are developing or not. On the other hand, the reason why this phenomenon occurred is the city itself. The density and size will affect the distribution of each family. That is why in some regions, the concentration of childless family is higher.<br><br>
