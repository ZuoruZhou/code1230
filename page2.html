 <p>Figure – 2: the Growth of Childless Couple in Sydney from 2011 to 2016 <a href="https://zuoruzhou.github.io/mapwebsite/">Click Here to Visit Full 3D Model Generated from Mapbox </a><br><br>

<p>The map shows the change of the family without child living area in NSW from 2011 to 2016, and where these families are concentrated. The colour scale from white to orange illustrate the population change of childless families. The height of ‘bars’ describes the percent growth of this kind of families, the greater proportion the higher the region is shown. <br><br>
 
 
<p>The initial research was to analyze the different family composition in Sydney. In the given data set, G39 category shows the lone people and young couple would be willing to live in the city or other place close to public transport. However, the families with children would like to live in quiet region or rural suburb rather than city regions. Thus, the city actually can be considered as kind of lonely place for young people to work in concrete offices.  <br><br>
 
<p>Then, I choose the families or couples without children to be my aim in this assignment. Because they would result some socio phenomenon in contemporary society. And the city’s factor could be a the most important reason in this case. Standard family would like to stay living in open spaces where is relatively far away from city. However, the accommodation cost in city would much higher than other regions. Therefore, young couple are encouraged to earn more money in this competitive region and having children for them might result inconvenience in this case. <br><br>


   
<p>Moreover, the distribution of the household and family composition have significant differences to others. The city and north Sydney area has more apartments and flats compared to other dwelling type. That because it needs to satisfy citizens’ need such as convenient transport net. The further west from city, the more houses with families with children start to appear in the map. This can prove that the property in the west region is cheaper than city and north Sydney area. <br><br> 
<p>Finally, the map illustrates the distribution of the population of childless families living in flats or apartments across NSW compared with other dwelling structure and family composition. It is obvious that childless families were concentrated in urban areas. In addition, the map shows the overall childless families were increasing from 2011 to 2016. However, in eastern suburbs the rate was an increasing trend while the western suburb was decreasing.  <br><br>

<p>In conclusion, the childless families can be considered as socio-economic factors. The latte line divides the differences between cultural values. For example, western areas would have greater rate of birth than eastern area. Thus, wealth is the most important factor influenced the childless family. Moreover, the distribution and concentration of childless family illustrates whether the cities are developing or not. On the other hand, the reason why this phenomenon occurred is the city itself. The density and size will affect the distribution of each family. That is why in some regions, the concentration of childless family is higher.<br><br>
