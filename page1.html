<h1>Data Analysis</h1>
Z5027150 Zuoru Zhou

<p>Data journalism is a journalism specialty reflecting the increased role that numerical data is used in the production and distribution of information in the digital era. It reflects the increased interaction between content producers (journalist) and several other fields such as design, computer science and statistics. From the point of view of journalists, it represents "an overlapping set of competencies drawn from disparate fields"<br><br>
<p>The data set I selected is dwelling structure by household composition and family composition. It mainly talks about the type of houses and people who live in these houses across Sydney in 2011 and 2016. <br><br>


<p>The government departments can use this data. For example, the Department of Energy NSW can use it in order to analyze the comparing of energy consumption between different types of building. In addition, the people who living these building will be analyzed as well because they are using energy and in direct contact with the environment. <br><br>
 
<p>Moreover, the government would use this data to renew the old city. It is necessary to change the road network after certainly period if the family composition changed in an area. For example, the area where has more younger people would need more roads or travelling mode to schools and offices. For children, they might need to have more secure playground close to their home. All these data could be used to develop the city. <br><br>
 
 <p>It is useful for real estate agencies to give professional suggestion to potential buyers about how well the property is. This will allow buyers to think whether the house is satisfied their desire or not. Besides, the data allow buyers to know what is the most family type in this area as they might want to live in a place with similar family. <br><br>

<p>The former monotonous metro station can only offer metro services but Todtown would change the original service mode to multi-service within a building complex. Multi-transport including bus, subway and taxi will be included in its transport service however the Todtown can offer commercial service such as shopping, accommodation and office as well.<br><br>


   
<p>The proposed residential-office-retail-hotel projects sits on topof the 20 year-old Xinzhuang metro station. It will comprise 1000 uniits and seviced apartmetns, a shopping mall, a hotel and office palce. So ti changed original underground transport mode to an integral and inovative transport hub.<br><br> 


  
<p>(1)	(1)	The old metro staion looks like a box that can only provided metro service.  <br><br>
<p>(2)	(2)	To extend the middle part of the original box allow more activitis to occur. Then lift it up to form a place under the cantilever part would create bike path, walk path and other tranport mode centre.  <br><br>

<p>(3)	(3)	To set up a roof terrace on the top of the building to create more activities in vertical direction. Buildings, gardens and nature will generate a new community within the building complex.

To build this kind of transport hub can effectively give locals and vistors more traveling modes. Besides, the concept of ‘Community in a community’ builds a new sustainable CBD offerd a range of interactivities between publics, nature and architecture. However, it is important to have approvals from government to start this urban transformation and exibition of the project provided by relative departments should be hold. That is used to collect citizens’ willings.

<p>The Todtown integrated both the commercial and environmental aspects into the design. The transit oriented mixed-use development will be a new destination that boasts positive lifestyle and leisure to the new surrounding residential community and is set to become a new commercial regional retail center in Shanghai.

The project would cost about US$1.5 billion (about A$1.8 billion) and be completed by 2020 (Leanna, 2017). The duration is too long which would make a range of bad issues to locals and environment. As it cost too much money, there is no enough evidence to state this project can get enough profit back.
